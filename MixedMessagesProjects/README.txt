# CodeCademy JavaScript Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of coding projects that I am completing to learn JavaScript through CodeCademy's Full-Stack Development Course.

## Project List

1. Project 1: Mixed Message Generator
    - Description: Generating Mixed Messages with each program
    - Using API's to get multiple messages
    - Working messages so far include a random Kanye West Quote, Evil Insult or Inspirational Quote - Happy with my interaction with API's and JSON for beginner projects, so might move on.

    - Idea to expands would be to display one insult/quote etc as a paragraph in DOM on personal website, plan to play aroudn with that soon.
